#' Apply operators
#'
#' The apply utility runs the named operators on each input file. The input files must be enclosed in square brackets. This utility can only be used on a series of input files. These are all operators with more than one input file (infiles). Here is an incomplete list of these operators: copy, cat, merge, mergetime, select, ENSSTAT. The parameter operators is a blank-separated list of CDO operators. Use quotation marks if more than one operator is needed. Each operator may have only one input and output stream.
