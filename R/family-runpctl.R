#' Running percentile values
#'
#' This module computes running percentiles over a selected number of timesteps in infile. The time of outfile is determined by the time in the middle of all contributing timesteps of infile. This can be change with the CDO option --timestat_date &lt;first|middle|last&gt;.  o(t+(nts-1)/2,x) = pth percentile \{i(t,x), i(t+1,x), ..., i(t+nts-1,x)\}
