#' Wind transformation
#'
#' This module contains CDO operators with an interface to NCL functions. The corresponding NCL functions have the same name. A more detailed description of those NCL function can be found on the NCL homepage https://www.ncl.ucar.edu.

#'     uv2vr_cfd  U and V wind to relative vorticity
#'                Computes relative vorticity for a latitude-longitude grid using centered finite differences.
#'                The grid need not be global and missing values are allowed.
#'     uv2dv_cfd  U and V wind to divergence
#'                Computes divergence for a latitude-longitude grid using centered finite differences.
#'                The grid need not be global and missing values are allowed.
