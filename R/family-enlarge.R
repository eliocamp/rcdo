#' Enlarge fields
#'
#' Enlarge all fields of infile to a user given horizontal grid. Normally only the last field element is used for the enlargement. If however the input and output grid are regular lon/lat grids, a zonal or meridional enlargement is possible. Zonal enlargement takes place, if the xsize of the input field is 1 and the ysize of both grids are the same. For meridional enlargement the ysize have to be 1 and the xsize of both grids should have the same size.
