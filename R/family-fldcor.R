#' Correlation in grid space
#'
#' The correlation coefficient is a quantity that gives the quality of a least squares fitting to the original data. This operator correlates all gridpoints of two fields for each timestep. With  S(t) = \{x, i_1(t,x) != missval and i_2(t,x) != missval\}  it is  o(t,1) = Cor\{(i_1(t,x), i_2(t,x)), x_1 &lt; x &lt;= x_n\}  where w(x) are the area weights obtained by the input streams. For every timestep t only those field elements x belong to the sample, which have i_1(t,x) != missval and i_2(t,x) != missval.
