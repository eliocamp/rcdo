#' Statistical values over grid boxes
#'
#' This module computes statistical values over surrounding grid boxes. Depending on the chosen operator, the minimum, maximum, range, sum, average, standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis or median of the neighboring grid boxes is written to outfile. All gridbox operators only work on quadrilateral curvilinear grids.
