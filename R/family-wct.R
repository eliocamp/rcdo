#' Windchill temperature
#'
#' Let infile1 and infile2 be time series of temperature and wind speed fields, then a corresponding time series of resulting windchill temperatures is written to outfile. The wind chill temperature calculation is only valid for a temperature of T &lt;= 33 °C and a wind speed of v &gt;= 1.39 m/s. Whenever these conditions are not satisfied, a missing value is written to outfile. Note that temperature and wind speed fields have to be given in units of °C and m/s, respectively.
