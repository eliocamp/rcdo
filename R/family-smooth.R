#'     smooth   Smooth grid points
#'              Performs a N point smoothing on all input fields. The number of points used depend
#'              on the search radius (radius) and the maximum number of points (maxpoints).
#'              Per default all points within the search radius of 1degree are used.
#'              The weights for the points depend on the form of the curve and the distance.
#'              The implemented form of the curve is linear with constant default weights of 0.25
#'              at distance 0 (weight0) and at the search radius (weightR).
#'     smooth9  9 point smoothing
#'              Performs a 9 point smoothing on all fields with a quadrilateral curvilinear grid.
#'              The result at each grid point is a weighted average of the grid point plus
#'              the 8 surrounding points. The center point receives a weight of 1.0, the 
#'              points at each side and above and below receive a weight of 0.5, and corner 
#'              points receive a weight of 0.3.
#'              All 9 points are multiplied by their weights and summed, then divided by 
#'              the total weight to obtain the smoothed value. Any missing data points are 
#'              not included in the sum; points beyond the grid boundary are considered to 
#'              be missing. Thus the final result may be the result of an averaging with less 
#'              than 9 points.
