#' Multiyear daily arithmetic
#'
#' This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one timestep with the same day of year. For each field in infile1 the corresponding field of the timestep in infile2 with the same day of year is used. The input files need to have the same structure with the same variables. Usually infile2 is generated by an operator of the module YDAYSTAT.
