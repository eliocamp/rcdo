#' Regression

#' The values of the input file infile are assumed to be distributed as N(a+b*t,S^2) with unknown a, b and S^2. This operator estimates the parameter b. For every field element x only those timesteps t belong to the sample S(x), which have i(t,x) NE miss. It is assumed that all timesteps are equidistant, if this is not the case set the parameter equal=false.
