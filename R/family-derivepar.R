#' Derived model parameters
#'
#' This module contains operators that calculate derived model parameters. These are currently the parameters sea level pressure and geopotential height. All necessary input variables are identified by their GRIB1 code number or the NetCDF CF standard name. Supported GRIB1 parameter tables are: WMO standard table number 2 and ECMWF local table number 128.

#'     sealevelpressure  Sea level pressure
#'                       This operator computes the sea level pressure (air_pressure_at_sea_level). Required input fields
#'                       are surface_air_pressure, surface_geopotential and air_temperature on full hybrid sigma pressure levels.
#'     gheight           Geopotential height on full-levels
#'                       This operator computes the geopotential height (geopotential_height) on model full-levels in metres.
#'                       Required input fields are surface_air_pressure, surface_geopotential, specific_humidity and air_temperature
#'                       on full hybrid sigma pressure levels. Note, this procedure is an approximation, which doesn't take into
#'                       account the effects of e.g. cloud ice and water, rain and snow.
#'     gheight_half      Geopotential height on half-levels
#'                       This operator computes the geopotential height (geopotential_height) on model half-levels in metres.
#'                       Required input fields are surface_air_pressure, surface_geopotential, specific_humidity and air_temperature
#'                       on full hybrid sigma pressure levels. Note, this procedure is an approximation, which doesn't take into
