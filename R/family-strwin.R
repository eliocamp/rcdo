#' Strong wind days index per time period
#'
#' Let infile be a time series of the daily maximum horizontal wind speed VX, then the number of days where VX &gt; v is counted. The horizontal wind speed v is an optional parameter with default v = 10.5 m/s. A further output variable is the maximum number of consecutive days with maximum wind speed greater than or equal to v. Note that both VX and v have to be given in units of m/s. Also note that the horizontal wind speed is defined as the square root of the sum of squares of the zonal and meridional wind speeds. The date information of a timestep in outfile is the date of the last contributing timestep in infile.
