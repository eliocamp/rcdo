#' Verify grid coordinates
#'
#' This operator verifies the coordinates of all horizontal grids found in infile. Among other things, it searches for duplicate cells, non-convex cells, and whether the center is located outside the cell bounds. Use the CDO option -v to output the position of these cells. This information can be useful to avoid problems when interpolating the data.
