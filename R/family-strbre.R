#' Strong breeze days index per time period
#'
#' Let infile be a time series of the daily maximum horizontal wind speed VX, then the number of days where VX is greater than or equal to 10.5 m/s is counted. A further output variable is the maximum number of consecutive days with maximum wind speed greater than or equal to 10.5 m/s. Note that VX is defined as the square root of the sum of squares of the zonal and meridional wind speeds and have to be given in units of m/s. The date information of a timestep in outfile is the date of the last contributing timestep in infile.
