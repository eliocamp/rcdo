\description{
Packing reduces the data volume by reducing the precision of the stored numbers. It is implemented using the NetCDF attributes add_offset and scale_factor. The operator unpack unpack all packed variables. The default data type for all variables is automatically changed to 32-bit floats. Use the CDO option -b F64 to change the data type to 64-bit floats, if needed.
