\title{Frost days where no snow index per time period}
\usage{
cdo_fdns(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ifile1, ifile2}{Strings with the path to the input files.}

\item{ofile}{String with the path to the output file.}
}
\value{
Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the
output files.

Operators that output an indefinite number of files return a string with the
basename of the files.

Operatos that don't return filenames return a character vector with the
string output.

\description{
Let infile1 be a time series of the daily minimum temperature TN and infile2 be a corresponding series of daily surface snow amounts. Then the number of days where TN < 0 Â°C and the surface snow amount is less than 1 cm is counted. The temperature TN have to be given in units of Kelvin. The date information of a timestep in outfile is the date of the last contributing timestep in infile.
