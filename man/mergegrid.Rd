cdo_mergegrid(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

\item{ofile}{String with the path to the output file.}
}
\value{
Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the

\description{
Merges grid points of all variables from infile2 to infile1 and write the result to outfile. Only the non missing values of infile2 will be used. The horizontal grid of infile2 should be smaller or equal to the grid of infile1 and the resolution must be the same. Only rectilinear grids are supported. Both input files need to have the same variables and the same number of timesteps.
