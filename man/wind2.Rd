\title{D and V to velocity potential and stream function}
\usage{
cdo_dv2ps(ifile, ofile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ifile}{String with the path to the input file.}

\item{ofile}{String with the path to the output file.}
}
\value{
Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the
output files.

Operators that output an indefinite number of files return a string with the
basename of the files.

Operatos that don't return filenames return a character vector with the
string output.
}
\description{
Calculate spherical harmonic coefficients of velocity potential and stream function from spherical harmonic coefficients of relative divergence and vorticity. The divergence and vorticity need to have the names sd and svo or code numbers 155 and 138.
