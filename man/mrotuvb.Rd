\title{Backward rotation of MPIOM data}
\usage{
cdo_mrotuvb(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ifile1, ifile2}{Strings with the path to the input files.}

\item{ofile}{String with the path to the output file.}
}
\value{
Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the
output files.

Operators that output an indefinite number of files return a string with the
basename of the files.

Operatos that don't return filenames return a character vector with the
string output.
}
\description{
MPIOM data are on a rotated Arakawa C grid. The velocity components U and V are located on the edges of the cells and point in the direction of the grid lines and rows. With mrotuvb the velocity vector is rotated in latitudinal and longitudinal direction. Before the rotation, U and V are interpolated to the scalar points (cell center). U is located with the coordinates for U in infile1 and V in infile2. mrotuvb assumes a positive meridional flow for a flow from grid point(i,j) to grid point(i,j+1) and positive zonal flow for a flow from grid point(i+1,j) to point(i,j).

This is a specific implementation for data from the MPIOM model, it may not work with data from other sources.
