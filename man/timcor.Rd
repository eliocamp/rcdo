\description{
The correlation coefficient is a quantity that gives the quality of a least squares fitting to the original data. This operator correlates each gridpoint of two fields over all timesteps. If there is only one input field, the p-value (probability value) is also written out. With  S(x) = \{t, i_1(t,x) != missval and i_2(t,x) != missval\}  it is  o(1,x) = Cor\{(i_1(t,x), i_2(t,x)), t_1 < t <= t_n\}  For every gridpoint x only those timesteps t belong to the sample, which have i_1(t,x) != missval and i_2(t,x) != missval.
