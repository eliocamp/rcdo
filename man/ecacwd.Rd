\usage{
cdo_eca_cwd(ifile, R = NULL, N = NULL, freq = NULL, ofile = NULL)

cdo_etccdi_cwd(ifile, R = NULL, N = NULL, freq = NULL, ofile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ifile}{String with the path to the input file.}

\item{R}{FLOAT - Precipitation threshold (unit: mm; default: R = 1 mm)}

\item{N}{INTEGER - Minimum number of days exceeded (default: N = 5)}

\item{freq}{STRING - Output frequency (year, month)}

\item{ofile}{String with the path to the output file.}
}
\description{
Let infile be a time series of the daily precipitation amount RR, then the largest number of consecutive days where RR is at least R is counted. R is an optional parameter with default R = 1 mm. A further output variable is the number of wet periods of more than N days. Parameter is a comma-separated list of "key=values" pairs.

            The operator counts over the entire time series.
            The date information of a timestep in outfile is the date of
            the last contributing timestep in infile.
etccdi_cwd  Consecutive wet days index per time period
            The default output frequency is yearly.
            Periods within overlapping years are accounted for the first year.
            The date information of a timestep in outfile is the mid of
            the frequency interval.
