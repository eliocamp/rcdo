\title{Import binary data sets}
\usage{
cdo_import_binary(ifile, ofile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ifile}{String with the path to the input file.}

\item{ofile}{String with the path to the output file.}
}
\value{
Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the
output files.

Operators that output an indefinite number of files return a string with the
basename of the files.

Operators that don't return filenames return a character vector with the
string output.
}
\description{
This operator imports gridded binary data sets via a GrADS data descriptor file. The GrADS data descriptor file contains a complete description of the binary data as well as instructions on where to find the data and how to read it. The descriptor file is an ASCII file that can be created easily with a text editor. The general contents of a gridded data descriptor file are as follows: - Filename for the binary data - Missing or undefined data value - Mapping between grid coordinates and world coordinates - Description of variables in the binary data set  A detailed description of the components of a GrADS data descriptor file can be found in GrADS. Here is a list of the supported components: BYTESWAPPED, CHSUB, DSET, ENDVARS, FILEHEADER, HEADERBYTES, OPTIONS, TDEF, TITLE, TRAILERBYTES, UNDEF, VARS, XDEF, XYHEADER, YDEF, ZDEF
