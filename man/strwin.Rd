\title{Strong wind days index per time period}
\usage{
cdo_strwin(ifile, v = NULL, ofile = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{ifile}{String with the path to the input file.}

\item{v, }{FLOAT - Horizontal wind speed threshold (m/s, default v = 10.5 m/s)}

\item{ofile}{String with the path to the output file.}
}
\description{
Let infile be a time series of the daily maximum horizontal wind speed VX, then the number of days where VX > v is counted. The horizontal wind speed v is an optional parameter with default v = 10.5 m/s. A further output variable is the maximum number of consecutive days with maximum wind speed greater than or equal to v. Note that both VX and v have to be given in units of m/s. Also note that the horizontal wind speed is defined as the square root of the sum of squares of the zonal and meridional wind speeds. The date information of a timestep in outfile is the date of the last contributing timestep in infile.
