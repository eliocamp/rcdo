# Extremely wet days wrt 99th percentile of reference period

Let infile1 be a time series RR of the daily precipitation amount at wet
days (precipitation \>= 1 mm) and infile2 be the 99th percentile RRn99
of the daily precipitation amount at wet days for any period used as
reference. Then the percentage of wet days with RR \> RRn99 is
calculated. RRn99 is calculated as the 99th percentile of all wet days
of a given climate reference period. Usually infile2 is generated by the
operator ydaypctl,99. The date information of a timestep in outfile is
the date of the last contributing timestep in infile1.

## Usage

``` r
cdo_eca_r99p(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- ifile1, ifile2:

  Strings with the path to the input files.

- ofile:

  String with the path to the output file.

## Value

Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the
output files.

Operators that output an indefinite number of files return a string with
the basename of the files.

Operatos that don't return filenames return a character vector with the
string output.
