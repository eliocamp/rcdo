# Multiyear monthly arithmetic

This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one timestep
with the same month of year. For each field in infile1 the corresponding
field of the timestep in infile2 with the same month of year is used.
The input files need to have the same structure with the same variables.
Usually infile2 is generated by an operator of the module YMONSTAT.

## Usage

``` r
cdo_ymonadd(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_ymondiv(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_ymonmul(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_ymonsub(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- ifile1, ifile2:

  Strings with the path to the input files.

- ofile:

  String with the path to the output file.

## Value

Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the
output files.

Operators that output an indefinite number of files return a string with
the basename of the files.

Operatos that don't return filenames return a character vector with the
string output.

## Details

    ymonadd  Add multi-year monthly time series
             Adds a time series and a multi-year monthly time series.
    ymonsub  Subtract multi-year monthly time series
             Subtracts a time series and a multi-year monthly time series.
    ymonmul  Multiply multi-year monthly time series
             Multiplies a time series with a multi-year monthly time series.
    ymondiv  Divide multi-year monthly time series
             Divides a time series by a multi-year monthly time series.
