# Yearly arithmetic

This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one timestep
with the same year. For each field in infile1 the corresponding field of
the timestep in infile2 with the same year is used. The header
information in infile1 have to be the same as in infile2. Usually
infile2 is generated by an operator of the module YEARSTAT.

## Usage

``` r
cdo_yearadd(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_yeardiv(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_yearmul(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_yearsub(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- ifile1, ifile2:

  Strings with the path to the input files.

- ofile:

  String with the path to the output file.

## Value

Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the
output files.

Operators that output an indefinite number of files return a string with
the basename of the files.

Operatos that don't return filenames return a character vector with the
string output.

## Details

    yearadd  Add yearly time series
             Adds a time series and a yearly time series.
    yearsub  Subtract yearly time series
             Subtracts a time series and a yearly time series.
    yearmul  Multiply yearly time series
             Multiplies a time series and a yearly time series.
    yeardiv  Divide yearly time series
             Divides a time series and a yearly time series.
