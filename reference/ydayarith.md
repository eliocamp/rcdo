# Multiyear daily arithmetic

This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one timestep
with the same day of year. For each field in infile1 the corresponding
field of the timestep in infile2 with the same day of year is used. The
input files need to have the same structure with the same variables.
Usually infile2 is generated by an operator of the module YDAYSTAT.

## Usage

``` r
cdo_ydayadd(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_ydaydiv(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_ydaymul(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_ydaysub(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- ifile1, ifile2:

  Strings with the path to the input files.

- ofile:

  String with the path to the output file.

## Value

Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the
output files.

Operators that output an indefinite number of files return a string with
the basename of the files.

Operatos that don't return filenames return a character vector with the
string output.

## Details

    ydayadd  Add multi-year daily time series
             Adds a time series and a multi-year daily time series.
    ydaysub  Subtract multi-year daily time series
             Subtracts a time series and a multi-year daily time series.
    ydaymul  Multiply multi-year daily time series
             Multiplies a time series and a multi-year daily time series.
    ydaydiv  Divide multi-year daily time series
             Divides a time series and a multi-year daily time series.
