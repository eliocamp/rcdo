# Precipitation percent due to R75p days

Let infile1 be a time series RR of the daily precipitation amount at wet
days (precipitation \>= 1 mm) and infile2 be the 75th percentile RRn75
of the daily precipitation amount at wet days for any period used as
reference. Then the ratio of the precipitation sum at wet days with RR
\> RRn75 to the total precipitation sum is calculated. RRn75 is
calculated as the 75th percentile of all wet days of a given climate
reference period. Usually infile2 is generated by the operator
ydaypctl,75. The date information of a timestep in outfile is the date
of the last contributing timestep in infile1.

## Usage

``` r
cdo_eca_r75ptot(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- ifile1, ifile2:

  Strings with the path to the input files.

- ofile:

  String with the path to the output file.

## Value

Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the
output files.

Operators that output an indefinite number of files return a string with
the basename of the files.

Operatos that don't return filenames return a character vector with the
string output.
