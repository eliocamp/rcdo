# Daily arithmetic

This module performs simple arithmetic of a time series and one timestep
with the same day, month and year. For each field in infile1 the
corresponding field of the timestep in infile2 with the same day, month
and year is used. The input files need to have the same structure with
the same variables. Usually infile2 is generated by an operator of the
module DAYSTAT.

## Usage

``` r
cdo_dayadd(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_daydiv(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_daymul(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)

cdo_daysub(ifile1, ifile2, ofile = NULL)
```

## Arguments

- ifile1, ifile2:

  Strings with the path to the input files.

- ofile:

  String with the path to the output file.

## Value

Operators that output one or more files return a character vector to the
output files.

Operators that output an indefinite number of files return a string with
the basename of the files.

Operatos that don't return filenames return a character vector with the
string output.

## Details

    dayadd  Add daily time series
            Adds a time series and a daily time series.
    daysub  Subtract daily time series
            Subtracts a time series and a daily time series.
    daymul  Multiply daily time series
            Multiplies a time series and a daily time series.
    daydiv  Divide daily time series
            Divides a time series and a daily time series.
